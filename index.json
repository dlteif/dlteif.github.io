Before joining BU, I received a Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree in Computer Science at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon. My research interests fall under the umbrella of explainable AI, efficient machine learning and computer vision. I am interested in improving applications at the intersection of AI and health care through interpretable, efficient and trustworthy machine learning models. As of Summer 2020, I have been working on explainability for tackling bias in medical imaging, specifically MRI brain scans, with Profs. Sarah Adel Bargal and Bryan A. Plummer, in collaboration with Professor Vijaya B. Kolachalama at the department of Medicine at BU.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://dlteif.github.io/author/diala-lteif/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/diala-lteif/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a third year Computer Science PhD student at Boston University advised by Professors Sarah Adel Bargal and Bryan A.
